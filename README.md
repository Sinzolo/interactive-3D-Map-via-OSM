# Interactive 3D Map via OSM

This is my Third Year Project for Lancaster University.
The project is to create a website that will generate and display a 3D interactive map of Lancaster University campus and the Lancaster city centre area using OpenStreetMap's large database of structures and their associated parameters.
Then, using this website, evaluate the possible use of 3D maps over 2D maps through a user study and a 10,000 word dissertation.

Things to note:
- You can only navigate to places on the Lancaster University campus.
- Use a phone to be able to look around kind of like VR.
- If on a computer, pressing 'v' will bring up debugging performance metrics and pressing 'c' will allow you to enter a debugging mode where you can fly around with wasd.
- If moving too quick, i.e. in a vehicle, the world may not load correctly and artifacts may appear. Due to the scope of the project being about using it for walking, I chose not to pursue this bug.
- One of the removed features was a height accurate floor that represented the real-world's elavation. Many remnants of this feature are still present in the code.
